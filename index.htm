        <h1>COTTAGE RENTAL - OTTAWA VALLEY</h1> 
        Perched among the trees on a rocky promontory overlooking the Coulonge river, this cottage was originally built in 1974 from 150 year old hand hewn timbers. It was renovated with great care in recent years to add modern amenities, while preserving the building's natural ambience. The cottage affords complete relaxation on a very private six acre property, and its abundant windows are unobstructed by curtains, offering wonderful views of the surrounding landscape, including the wide river as it bends around the point, and the lush mixed forest of the upper Gatineau hills in western Quebec, near Ottawa.
