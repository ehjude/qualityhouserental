<b>Hey Everyone!</b>  I was getting a lot of questions about the house I have advertised in my MSN, so I figured I'd put together a short n' sweet
summary of the house.  

<p>

Here you go:

<ul>
<li> Size: 3 Bedrooms
<li> Location: 525 Albert St., just north of Princess St. - 10 minute walk down to Union St.
<li> Quality: The house is about to undergo renovations for September 01, 2005.  This could be both good or bad: good if you want to
avoid renting a house for summer months that you're not here or bad if you plan on staying in Kingston over the summer.  Your call.
<li> Price: $1100/month, utilities not included
</ul>

The landlord is my dad, who owns a few properties in Kingston, and is definately not a slum lord.  He has renovated and rented three other properties
in the same way as this one is going to be done, so it'll be a solid job.  

<p>

Here are a few pictures from the last renovation.  Please note that this is <b> NOT </b> 
the rental in question, just an example of the kind of finished product there is a history of.<p>

<p> Interested?  Lonely?  Need someone to talk to?  Ok...maybe just the first one...If you are interested, give my old man a call at 542-4668, his
name is Paul, tell him Jude sent you!
